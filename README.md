Basic neural network from scratch!

Artificial neural network architecture:
    1. input layer = 64 neurons (input image array)
    2. hidden layer 1 = 10 neurons (arbitrary)
    3. hidden layer 2 = 10 neurons (arbitrary)
    4. output layer = 10 neurons (output one-hot array)
    5. sigmoidal activation in the two hidden layers
    6. softmax activation in the output layer
    7. cost function = cross-entropy
    8. learning rate = 2
    9. epochs = 1500
    
You can play around by changing the number of neurons in the hidden layers, learning rate and the number of epochs.
